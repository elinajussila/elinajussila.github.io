## About me

I am a PhD student in Economics at Tampere University and a member of the Finnish Centre of Excellence in Tax Systems Research ([FIT](https://verotutkimus.fi/en/home/)). My primary research interests are in public and health economics, with a current focus on the roles of the public sector and public health insurance in healthcare. I am supervised by Professors Kaisa Kotakorpi and Jarkko Harju. During the 2023–2024 academic year, I visited the University of California, Berkeley.
