## About me

I am an PhD student in Economics at Tampere University and a member of the Finnish Centre of Excellence in Tax Systems Research ([FIT](https://verotutkimus.fi/en/home/)). My primary research interests are in public and health economics, with a current focus on the roles of the public sector and public health insurance in healthcare. I'm supervised by professors Kaisa Kotakorpi and Jarkko Harju. During the academic year 2023-2024 I visited University of California, Berkeley.
